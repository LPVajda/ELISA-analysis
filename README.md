# ELISA-analysis
This repository contains the code used to analyse the ELISA measurement.
Feel free to use the concept.
Readout data was separated into two files and converted to .txt format (be careful with "." and ",")
One file for the calibration data and one for the actual measurements.
For the measuremnts during the course I provide the two .txt file in this repository.
The ELISA-Analysis code is specifically tailored to the dataset it was first used for therefore it e.g.: contains a step that removes one of the calibration values due to being an outlier.
The code needs to updated depending on the dataset.
