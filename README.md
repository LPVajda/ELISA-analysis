# ELISA-analysis
This repository contains the code used to analyse the ELISA measurement
Feel free to use the concept.
Readout data was separated into two files and converted to .txt format (be careful with "." and ",")
One file for the calibration data and one for the actual measurements.
For the measuremnts during the course I provide the two .txt file in this repository.
